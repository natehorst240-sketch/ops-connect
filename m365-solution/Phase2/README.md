# Phase 2 — Operations Layer

Layers operations on top of the Phase 1 audit + approval surface. Phase 1
establishes the request → decision pipeline; Phase 2 brings in the source
systems that hold the actual schedule and the live fleet position data.

**Status:** Proposed. Starts after Phase 1 acceptance criteria are met.
**Estimated effort:** 10–14 weeks, 1–2 Power Platform devs + IT liaison.

## What ships in Phase 2

- **Resource Scheduler** — read-only Gantt mirror of CompleteFlight (inspections,
  training) and ProteanHub (missions, MX, AOG, PR). 7-day timeline view
  with per-aircraft rows. Edits made at source; MX Connect is read-only.
- **Fleet Map** — stock Power Apps map control rendering aircraft positions
  from SkyRouter. 15-minute refresh cadence. No bearing rotation, no
  custom basemap (those land in Phase 3).
- **Server-side conflict + coverage gap detection** — a Power Automate flow
  scans `cr_schedule_event` and `cr_fleet_position`, computes overlaps,
  AOG cascades, coverage gaps, and writes results to `cr_conflict`. Runs
  on every source-system sync.
- **Time off + open shift workflows** — same Phase 1 pipeline (canvas form
  → Adaptive Card → RMM decision → Outlook event), reused for two new
  request types.
- **Bulletins + safety reports** — lightweight forms + Teams broadcast.

## Stack additions over Phase 1

- 4 custom connectors (Veryon, CompleteFlight, ProteanHub, SkyRouter) with
  API key auth, OpenAPI 2.0 swagger definitions
- 4 new Dataverse tables: `cr_aircraft`, `cr_schedule_event`,
  `cr_fleet_position`, `cr_conflict`
- 3 scheduled flows: scheduler poll, fleet position poll, conflict detection
- 2 new canvas screens: Scheduler, Fleet Map
- Phone-form-factor refresh of the existing canvas app

## Dependencies on Phase 1

- `cr_audit` table (Phase 2 audit events join Phase 1 audit chain)
- Adaptive Card pipeline (reused for time-off + open shift)
- Outlook calendar pattern (reused for crew assignments)
- `MXC AMT`, `MXC RMM`, `MXC Director` security roles (extended with
  Phase 2 table privileges)

## What's here

- `runbook.md` — week-by-week deployment (lighter than Phase 1's runbook
  since Phase 2 inherits the operational pattern Phase 1 establishes)
- `tables.md` — schema specs for `cr_aircraft`, `cr_schedule_event`,
  `cr_fleet_position`, `cr_conflict`
- `connectors.md` — OpenAPI sketch for each of the 4 source-system
  connectors
- `powerfx.md` — Power Fx for Scheduler + Fleet Map screens
- `flows/` — (forthcoming) flow JSON for the 3 polling + detection flows

## Pre-flight checklist (start when Phase 1 is in UAT)

- [ ] Veryon API key procured (typically 2–3 weeks)
- [ ] CompleteFlight API key procured (2–4 weeks)
- [ ] ProteanHub API key procured (2–4 weeks)
- [ ] SkyRouter API key procured (1–2 weeks)
- [ ] DLP review extended to cover the 4 new connectors
- [ ] Confirm Power Automate flow run quota is sufficient (Phase 2 polling
      adds ~144 + 96 + 96 + 96 = ~432 runs/day across the 4 polls)
